                <p>My name is Charlie, and I have been on a computer since I was a toddler (maybe even before that). I have always been a problem-solver, so it made sense to take my knowledge of computers and combine it with that by going into the computer science field! I started this by taking some classes at my local community college, which included completing a Java course. However, the pace and spread-out feel of my courses left me wanting something more in depth and stimulating, so I opted for a different approach: starting a software engineering bootcamp at Flatiron School! So far I have been learning some basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and by the end of my course I will have all of the knowledge needed to pursue my career as a Full-Stack Developer. Thank you for viewing the second iteration of my personal website that I made as a personal project!
